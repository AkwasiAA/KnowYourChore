# KnowYourChore (4 max)

You have been noticing more and more that the household tasks are piling up and piling up. You think that the best way would be to  make a task board in the kitchen so everyone can see but find that people aren't looking up from their phones. So what you decide is that the best way is to create an application that will have a shared list for all to see and contribute to.

## MVP

A user will be able to access the application to view the list of tasks.

- They will be able to add, complete, update and remove tasks
-They will be able to add users who can work on tasks.
- They can pin a task to a user.
- They can add time,date and description to task.
- There will be push notifications when the user is near time of completion or at a certain time during the day.

## Extensions

- The user can add reward points to tasks.
- The users will have a point goal for the week.
- The user can remove points if tasks are not complete in time.

## Technology

- React.Native for the front end application focussing on building an Android application.
- Javascript , Mongodb and Express for the Back end
- Would like to explore the possibilities of Java and Spring as the back end if there is enough time to build this.
